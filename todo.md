- fix wiki pages
- move wiki to pages (org or project?)
- ~~update pyamg.org~~
- ~~specific points~~
- point to code
- point to examples
- ~~analytics (google or bitdeli?)~~
- update install scripts
- C impacts: adaptive, aggregate, aggregation, rootnode, smooth, classical, split, smoothing, and of course strength
- **move pre/post smoother to solve, not setup?**
- move improve_candidates before strength?  (test before/after)
- clean up symmetry flag, maybe warn the user if flag is nonsymmetric, but
  improve_candidates or pre/postsmoother is not gauss_seidel_nr/ne
- (JS: Done) clearly block out strength, aggregation, interp routines
- (JS: Done) unifify the return of C from all strength of connection in aggregation and RS
- (JS: Done) C can be float in [0,1] or bool
- (JS: Done) make diagonal C in routine (does this work for RS?)
- (JS: Done) fix unamal doc string.  it makes all ones
- (JS: Done) move BImprove before strength?  (test before/after)
- (JS: Done) move preprocess_Bimprove
- (JS: Done) move default option from preprocess_Bimprove somewhere else
- (JS: Done) change Bimprove to improve_candidates  (consistent with adaptive SA solver)
- (JS: Done) change 'scheme' to consistent usage
- (JS: Done) rename preprocess_Bimprove, preprocess_str_or_agg, preprocess_smooth to levelize
- (JS: Done) fix returns for preprocess
