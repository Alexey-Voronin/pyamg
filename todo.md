- fix wiki pages
- move wiki to pages (org or project?)
- update pyamg.org
- specific points 
- point to code
- point to examples
- analytics (google or bitdeli?)
- update install scripts
- unifify the return of C from all strength of connection in aggregation and RS
- C can be float in [0,1] or bool
- make diagonal C in routine (does this work for RS?)
- C impacts: adaptive, aggregate, aggregation, rootnode, smooth, classical, split, smoothing, and of course strength
- fix unamal doc string.  it makes all ones
- clearly block out strength, aggregation, interp routines
- move BImprove before strength?  (test before/after)
- move preprocess_Bimprove
- move default option from preprocess_Bimprove somewhere else
- change Bimprove to improve_candidates  (consistent with adaptive SA solver)
- change 'scheme' to consistent usage
- rename preprocess_Bimprove, preprocess_str_or_agg, preprocess_smooth to levelize
- fix returns for preprocess
- clean up symmetry flag

- move pre/post smoother to solve, not setup?
- clearly block out strength, aggregation, interp routines
- move improve_candidates before strength?  (test before/after)
- clean up symmetry flag, maybe warn the user if flag is nonsymmetric, but
  improve_candidates or pre/postsmoother is not gauss_seidel_nr/ne

--> Egrep for preprocess in examples and pyamg
-->  Run all the examples...make sure that they work, especially solver diagonstics
